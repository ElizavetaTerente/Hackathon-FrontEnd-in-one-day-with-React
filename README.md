# Frontend in One Day with React (Hackathon) 

This project was created during a hackathon, where each participant was assigned a frontend framework they had not worked with before, along with a set of APIs providing data for visualization.

_How to run the app:_
1) Start the mock server with the command: __node mock-server.js__ (Make sure you're in the same folder as the mock-server.js file)

2) Start the frontend with the command: __npm start__

The frontend displays trainings data and their related statistics:
